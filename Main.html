                <h1>WELCOME</h1>
                <p>This website is about the game imscared.<br></p>
                <p>imscared is a pixelated horror game that really kicked off the genre of both pixelated horror and horror games that break the forth wall.<br></p>
                <p>imscared uses a folder on the desktop to both help and scare the player.</p>
                <p>For example, you could be met with a door that needs to be unlocked but you are unable to until you delete a file named 'lock'.<br></p>
                <p>This game loves to mess with the player and trick them, it has a confusing story of pain, suffering and more.<br></p>
                <p>Be warned, as imscared depicts implied attempted suicide/implied suicide and other content of that nature.<br></p>

                <h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>
                <p>The simpliest answer is to that is WASD is to move, mouse is to look around, 'ctrl' is to crouch and 'e' is to interact.</p>
                <p>The gameplay loop is simple. Open the passage, find the heart and bring it to the 'exit door'.<br></p>
                <p>Once you enter... You may be asked what it's name is. It goes by many names, each being given through scenario. These names are given through gameplay and are how you get around in the game.</p>
                <p>If you wish to be given a basic idea on what you should do for the first puzzle, please watch the video below.<br></p>

                <h1>LORE</h1>
                <p>The lore of imscared is strange and unusual. It doesn't have a clear story but there are a few things that are absolutely clear.<br><br><b>Entites can be turned into data.</b></p>
                <p>Most of the story is handled in the game. Pieces of a jigsaw that doesn't have all the pieces. Even to this day, the story is confusing, convoluted and strange. Just keep exploring through the game and try to piece it all together on your own.</p>
